Q. 
Once upon a time, there was a file in my project that I would now like to be able to get.
The problem is I have no idea of when have I deleted it and on which path is was at.
How can I locate the commits of this file when it existed?

A.
If you do not know the exact path you may use
git log --all -- **/thefile.*
If you know the path the file was at, you can do this:
git log --all -- <path-to-file>
This should show a list of commits in all branches which touched that file. Then, you can find the version of the file you want, and display it with...
git show <SHA> -- <path-to-file>
(or restore it into your working copy with git checkout <SHA> -- <path-to-file>)
