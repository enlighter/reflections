What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I think it creates an initial metadata about folder stats n characteristics so that it can create an effective repository from the initialized folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is an intermediary stage between the status of the working directory and that of the repository.
	It allows us greater control n flexibility in creating a repo. It is like having stage rehearsals before a live play on stage. Allows us to optimize the repo according to needs before actually filing it.
